# Collecting Payment

Veloz kits uses `Lemonsqueezy` for handling payment within the codebase.

<Callout type="warning">
  Before we proceed, make sure you have a store on
  [Lemonsqueezy](https://lemonsqueezy.com), if not [follow this
  guide](/lemonsqueezy/store)
</Callout>

Before collecting payment in your app, you need to create products on your lemonsuqeezy store. This product are basically represented as pricing plans on your app. [Follow this guide](/lemonsqueezy/products)

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you have your `API_KEY` created already, if not [follow this
  guide](/lemonsqueezy/api-key) before proceeding further.
</Callout>

Once you have your products created, you would need the following config from lemonsuqeezy:

- `store_id` : This is the id of your store on lemonsqueezy.
- `product_id` : This is the id of the product you want to collect payment for.
- `variant_id` : This is the id of the variant of the product you want to collect payment for.

In **development** mode, veloz kits provide you **3** urls which helps you get this details while in development.

<Callout type="warning">
  Calling this url's in production would return an error. It has been configured
  to only work in development mode. Also make sure you are logged in before
  calling this url's.
</Callout>

Click on each links below to see the response you get from each url.

- **Store** [http://localhost:4000/api/lemonsqueezy/store](http://localhost:4000/api/lemonsqueezy/store)
- **Products** [http://localhost:4000/api/lemonsqueezy/product](http://localhost:4000/api/lemonsqueezy/product)
- **Variants** [http://localhost:4000/api/lemonsqueezy/variant](http://localhost:4000/api/lemonsqueezy/variant)

Calling each of those endpoints above should return a response like this:

# Pricing Plan

Veloz kit by default support 3 pricing plans, which are: `LITE`, `BASIC` & `PREMIUM`.

Youre'nt limitted to this config, you could customize this plan based on your preferrence.

## Updating Pricing Plan

### Javascript Language

Follow the instructions below based on the starter kit techstack you purchased.

#### Nextjs

If everything is set up correctly, it high time we update your pricing plan config on your app. Headover to `src/data/pricing/plan.(ts / js)`. Every plan is for your saas is managed within that file.

<Callout type="info">
  `Monthly` subscriptions only is supported for now.
</Callout>

Now simply update the pricing plans config based on the `priduct (id, amount, currency) , variants id, plan, name.` The `id` attribute on line 2 is just random and not part of lemonsqueezy product id.

<CH.Code>

```ts plan.ts
export const pricingPlans = [
  {
    id: "lite_84507",
    name: "Lite",
    key: "lite",
    duration: "monthly",
    pricing: {
      currency: "USD",
      amount: 4,
    },
    product_id: 147184,
    variant_id: 183156,
  },
  {
    id: "basic_104548",
    name: "Basic",
    key: "basic",
    duration: "monthly",
    pricing: {
      currency: "USD",
      amount: 9,
    },
    product_id: 149209,
    variant_id: 183213,
    recommended: true,
  },
  {
    id: "premium_123918",
    name: "Premium",
    key: "premium",
    duration: "monthly",
    pricing: {
      currency: "USD",
      amount: 20,
    },
    product_id: 147501,
    variant_id: 180561,
  },
] satisfies PricingPlan[];
```

```js plan.js
// Coming Soon
```

</CH.Code>

Once that has been completed, navigate to your dashboard of the starter kit. At the bottom left, there's an **upgrade button** present which enables a user to upgrade their account.

Once clicked, it shows opens up a _`PricingPlanModal()`_ component which showcases your pricing plans available from `plan.ts` file. The `plan.ts` file also controls what get shown on the pricing section on the landing page. [learn more](/pricing-page)

> If you already have an active subscription plan, one of the button with that active subscription plan would be disabled with a "Subscribed" label.

Clicking one of the subscribed button would create a lemonsqueezy checkout with the user details as `custom_data` and then redirect the user to lemonsqueezy store.

![image](/images/screenshots/ls-pay.png)

you could use the below `Test Cards` details

- **card number** - `4242-4242-4242-4242`
- **cvv** - `123`
- **expiry date** - `12/25`

Once payment has been made and was successfull lemonsqueezy sends a webhook containing the payment details. Learn more about [Lemonqueezy Webhooks](/lemonsqueezy/webhook)
