# Waitlist

Most times, you'll want to collect emails from your users before you launch your product, in this case, Veloz has a built-in waitlist **component** and **page** that let you do just that.

## How to use

<Callout type="info">
  Depending on the kit you purchase, you'll most likely find both the waitlist
  component and page inside `src/components/waitlist`.
</Callout>

You could simply use the waitlist component inside any page you want, but if you want to use the waitlist page, you'll need to add it to your `src/pages` (Nextjs support) folder.

<CH.Code showCopyButton={false}>

```js page.tsx
import WaitlistPage from "@/components/waitlist/page";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Make sure the rest of the components are commmented out if you choose to show the waitlist page only */}
      {/* navigation section */}
      {/* <TopBar /> */}

      {/* components sections */}
      {/* <Header />
        <Features />
        <Pricing />
        <FAQ />
        <Footer /> */}
      <WaitlistPage />
    </>
  );
}
```

```js component.tsx
import WaitlistFormComponent from "./component";

export default function AnyPage() {
  return <WaitlistFormComponent />;
}
```

## Managing Waitlist

By default, only user having `admin` role can manage waitlist users. If you want to view all signed up users, simply login and navigate to the `Waitlist` section on the sidebar (only Admin). There you would find lists of registered users and you can perform actions like `delete` or `exporting` the lists to csv file.
