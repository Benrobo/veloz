# Private Pages

Veloz provides some set of utilities function mean't to protect `routes` either server or client from getting access. This utilities function / components can be found in `src/lib/auth-helpers` folder.

## Client üñ•

### `withAuth`

`withAuth` is a higher order component that can be used to protect client side routes from getting access. It takes a component as an argument and returns a new and modified component that can be used to protect routes.

When a user isn't authenticated, the component will redirect the user to the login page. If the user is authenticated, the component will render the passed in component.

<Callout>
  Only use this HOC (High Order Component) to protect pages / components that
  are mean't to be accessed by authenticated users only.
</Callout>

<CH.Code showCopyButton={false}>
```js withAuth.tsx
import { FullPageLoader } from "@/components/Loader";
import { DataContext } from "@/context/DataContext";
import useAuthUser from "@/hooks/useAuthUser";
import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";
import React, { useCallback, useContext, useEffect } from "react";

export default function withAuth<P extends { children: React.ReactNode }>(
  Component: React.ComponentType<P>
) {
  const ComponentWithAuth = (props: P) => {...};
  return ComponentWithAuth;
}

````

```js withAuth.jsx
// Coming Soon
````

</CH.Code>

### `withoutAuth`

As the name implies `withoutAuth` the opposite of `withAuth`. It is used to protect client side routes from getting access. It takes a component as an argument and returns a new and modified component that can be used to protect routes.

When a user is authenticated, the component will redirect the user to the dashboard page. If the user isn't authenticated, the component will render the passed in component.

<Callout>
  Only use this HOC (High Order Component) to protect pages / components that
  are mean't to be accessed by unauthenticated users only. for eg authentication
  route / page
</Callout>

<CH.Code showCopyButton={false}>
```js withoutAuth.tsx
import { FullPageLoader } from "@/components/Loader";
import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

export function withoutAuth<P extends { children: React.ReactNode }>(
  Component: React.ComponentType<P>
) {
  const ComponentWithAuth = (props: P) => {...};
  return ComponentWithAuth;
}

````

```js withoutAuth.jsx
// Coming Soon
````

</CH.Code>

#### Use Case

Assuming we have a page called `dashboard.tsx` that should only be accessible by authenticated users only. We can use `withAuth` to protect the page from getting access by unauthenticated users. We can also use `withoutAuth` to protect a page that should only be accessible by unauthenticated users only.

<CH.Code showCopyButton={false}>

```js dashboard.(tsx / jsx) focus=1,11
import { withAuth } from "@/lib/auth-helpers";

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default withAuth(Dashboard);
```

```js auth.(tsx / jsx) focus=1,11
import { withoutAuth } from "@/lib/auth-helpers";

function Auth() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Authentication Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default withoutAuth(Auth);
```

</CH.Code>

## Server ‚òÅÔ∏è

Protecting API routes / endpoints is quite handled differently from that of client side pages / routes. Endpoints are protected using `isAuthenticated` middleware HOF (High Order Function) and can be found in `/src/app/api/middlewares/auth.(ts / js)` file.

### `isAuthenticated`

<CH.Code lineNumbers={true}>
```js auth.ts
export function isAuthenticated(fn: Function) {
    return async (req: NextApiRequest) => {
        const session = await getServerSession(nextAuthOptions);
        if (!session) {
            throw new HttpException(RESPONSE_CODE.UNAUTHORIZED, "Unauthorized", 401);
        }

        let user = null;

        // oauth provider like github sometimes dont include email
        if (session.user.email) {
            user = await prisma.users.findFirst({
                where: { email: session.user?.email as string },
            });
        } else {
            user = await prisma.users.findFirst({
                where: { uId: session.user?.id as string },
            });
        }

        if (!user) {
            throw new HttpException(
                RESPONSE_CODE.UNAUTHORIZED,
                `Unauthorized, Invalid Token`,
                403
            );
        }

        (req as any)["user"] = { id: user.uId };
        return await fn(req);

    }

};

````

```js auth.js
// Coming Soon
````

</CH.Code>

#### Use Case

Simply wrap your API route handler with _`isAuthenticated()`_ middleware to protect it from getting access by unauthenticated users.

<CH.Code showCopyButton={true} lineNumbers={true}>

```js user/route.ts focus=2,8:10
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { isAuthenticated } from "../middlewares/auth";
import CatchError from "../utils/_error";
import UserController from "../controllers/user.controller";

const userController = new UserController();

export const GET = CatchError(
    // mark
  isAuthenticated(async (req: NextRequest) => await userController.getUser(req))
);
```

</CH.Code>

Each time a request is made to the server for that specific endpoint and the user making the requests isn't authenticated, the server simply throw an error with status code `401` and message `Unauthorized`.
