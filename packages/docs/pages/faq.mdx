The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section on your website serves as a valuable resource for your customers. It helps address common queries, provide essential information, and contribute to a seamless user experience.

## Usage

Veloz offers a comprehensive solution for creating a professional FAQ section on your website. With its built-in FAQ component, you can easily address common queries, provide essential information, and enhance the overall user experience. To use the component simply import it from `src/components/landing/faq/index.tsx` and use it in your page like so:

```js focus=4
import { FAQ } from "src/components/landing/faq";

function Page() {
  return <FAQ />;
}
```

To update the FAQ questions and answers, simply edit the `src/data/landing/faq.ts` file.

```js
// FAQ DATA
export const FAQ_DATA = [
  {
    key: "faq1",
    question: "What is a good way to learn React?",
    answer:
      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla quam velit, vulputate eu pharetra nec, mattis ac neque.",
  },
  ...
]
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Tip:** Align your FAQ section with customer needs and pain points.
  Prioritize questions that address potential customer concerns and provide
  valuable information to enhance user experience and build trust.
