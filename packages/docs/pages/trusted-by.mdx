# Trusted By

Veloz provide a simple extendible component called `Trusted-By` which shows lists of trusted customers on your website.

## Usage

Simply edit the `src/data/landing/trustedBy.ts` by adding lists of trusted customers images to the lists:

```js
// trusted by data
const TRUSTED_MAKERS = [
  //   customer images
];

export default TRUSTED_MAKERS;
```

Then import the `TrustedBy` component in the `src/components/landing/testimonials/TrustedBy.tsx` and use within the header component.:

```js focus=6
import TrustedBy from "../testimonials/TrustedBy";

function Header() {
  return (
    <>
      <TrustedBy />
    </>
  );
}
```

Update the `TRUSTED_CUSTOMERS_COUNT` to reflect the number of customers you want to show. **Be Honest** and don't show what you don't have. If possible, get rid of the component if you don't have any customers yet.

<Callout type="info">
  **Tip :** Include a variety of well-known clients, partners, or brands to
  showcase the diversity and credibility of your customer base.
