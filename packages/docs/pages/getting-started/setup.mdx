## Getting Started

> Make sure you have the latest version of [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine.

<Steps>

### Step 1

**Install Veloz ClI**

```bash
# npm
npm install -g veeloz

# yarn
yarn global add veeloz
```

### Step 2

After installation of _veeloz_ cli, you would need to authenticate the cli with your Veeloz account token. You can get your token from [here](https://tryveeloz.com/settings).

Run the command below

```bash copy
veeloz auth
```

This would work you through the steps of authenticating your cli with your veloz account token.

### Step 3

**Create a new project**

After authenticating with the Veeloz CLI, use the following command to create a new project.

```bash copy
veeloz use kit-name
```

where `<kit-name>` are the available and purchased kits you have access to. You can get a list of available kits by visiting the [starterkits page](https://tryveeloz.com/kits).

Running the above command would work you through the steps of creating a new project.

</Steps>

ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've successfully created a new project. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

You can now go ahead and follow the steps needed based on the kit selected.
