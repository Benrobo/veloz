#### Customization

The pricing plan component simply uses data coming from **`src/data/pricing/plan.ts`**.
[Learn more](/payments#updating-pricing-plan) about configuring your pricing plans.

As for the features listed on each pricing plan cards, they are also coming from **`src/data/pricing/features.ts`** file.

<Callout type="warning">
  Notice the feature has an `id`, this property must match what is in the plan
  data, else it will not be displayed. Also the `isAvailable` property is used
  to determine if the feature is available for that plan or not.
</Callout>

<CH.Code>

```js features.ts
const pricingPlanFeatures = [
  {
    id: "lite_84507",
    features: [
      {
        title: "1 User",
        isAvailable: true,
      },
      {
        title: "3 Projects",
        isAvailable: true,
      },
      {
        title: "Email Support",
